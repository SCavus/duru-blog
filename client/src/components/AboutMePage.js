      <p>
        I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very
        enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine. My
        friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good
        sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I
        feel extremely comfortable with them.
